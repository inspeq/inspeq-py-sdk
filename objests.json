      "llm_output": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolves around four key principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, allowing for code reuse and hierarchical classification. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility and modularity in code design. Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential properties and hiding implementation details."

      "llm_output": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is based on the principle of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems that are similar in structure to the original problem. In each recursive call, the function operates on a smaller subset of the problem until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops. Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be defined in terms of smaller instances of the same problem, such as traversing tree structures, sorting algorithms, and mathematical computations like factorials and Fibonacci sequences."

      "llm_output": "Relational database management systems (RDBMS) offer several advantages, including data integrity, scalability, concurrency control, and ease of querying. With RDBMS, data integrity is maintained through the use of constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, which enforce rules for data consistency and accuracy. RDBMS are also highly scalable, allowing for the storage and retrieval of large volumes of data across multiple tables and databases. Concurrency control mechanisms ensure that multiple users can access and modify the database simultaneously without conflicting with each other. Additionally, RDBMS provide a standardized query language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), which enables users to retrieve and manipulate data using simple and powerful commands."

      "llm_output": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses various techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the desired output is known, to make predictions on new data. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data. Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Machine learning has numerous applications across various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare."

      "llm_output": "Good software design is characterized by several key principles, including modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, and reusability. Modularity involves breaking down a system into smaller, independent modules or components that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. Abstraction involves hiding unnecessary details and exposing only essential features or functionalities to simplify complexity and improve clarity. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class to control access and enforce data integrity. Reusability involves designing components or modules that can be reused across different parts of the system or in other projects, reducing duplication of effort and improving productivity."

      "llm_input_context": "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data...",
      "llm_output": "Functional programming languages are characterized by several key features, including first-class functions, immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative syntax. First-class functions treat functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results from other functions. Immutability refers to the practice of avoiding mutable state, where once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed, which reduces the risk of side effects and makes code easier to reason about. Higher-order functions enable the composition of functions by taking other functions as arguments or returning functions as results, providing flexibility and modularity in code design. Declarative syntax focuses on describing what should be done rather than how it should be done, emphasizing the use of expressions and transformations to manipulate data."

      "llm_output": "Cybersecurity encompasses several fundamental concepts, including confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and non-repudiation. Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the data. Integrity involves maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle, preventing unauthorized modifications or alterations. Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible and usable when needed, minimizing downtime and disruptions to operations. Authentication verifies the identity of users or entities attempting to access a system or resource, typically through credentials such as passwords, biometrics, or cryptographic keys. Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin or delivery of data and prevents parties from denying their involvement in a transaction or communication."
